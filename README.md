# RESTful API (Demo)
Basic RESTful API with GET, POST and DELETE Requests. Based on Node.js with Express and FS-modules.

## Make it works
Type the following in your Terminal:
1. *npm init* (Creates a package.json file.)
2. *npm install express --save* (Saves the installation locally in the node_modules directory and creates a directory express inside node_modules.)
