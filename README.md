# RESTful API (Demo)
Basic RESTful API with GET, POST and DELETE Requests. Based on Node.js with Express and FS-modules.

## Make it works
Type the following in your Terminal: *npm install express --save*

The command saves the installation locally in the node_modules directory and creates a directory express inside node_modules.
